# FX_Analyzer

Instruction to use the tool 
1- to run this program you need to install the Mathematica software on your computer.
2- copy all files from MathPackage and paste it into the ~\mathematica\AddOns\Packages. ~\mathematica is the directory that I installed Wolfram Mathematica software. 
(see the screen shot 1).
3- all other files must be located in same directory that you clone this project, such as your sourceTest.txt (the source code to be examined), three recognier file
(OneRecList.txt ,TwoRecList.txt,ThreeRecList.txt), a mathematica library file (JLinkNativeLibrary.dll), the main FX program (javaparser-core.jar) 
and the user interface program (FXUI.jar).
4- after running the FXUI.jar with this command " java -jar FXUI.jar " the UI program starts and you need to select the MathKernel.exe program. this core program is installed
in same location that you have mathematica installed.
